**Tags**: `React`, `single-page-app`, `movies`, `API`, `pagination`, `search`, `Netflix`, `Appwrite`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Vercel`

A single-page app built with **React 19**, allowing you to browse movies via an external API with pagination. The app includes a search feature and a Netflix-style top trending list based on user search activity. The more a movie is searched, the higher its ranking.

Fully responsive and deployed on [Vercel](https://react-project-2axai3tid-dinos-projects-e512e7ed.vercel.app/), or you can use `npm run dev` to start the application locally.

## Tools Used:
- **React 19**: Frontend framework for building the app.
- **Appwrite**: Backend for tracking user searches and recommending the top 5 movies.
- **Tailwind CSS v4.0**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform for hosting the app.
